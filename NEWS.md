webshot 0.5.5
=============

* Fixed #101, #116: When some parameters (like `cliprect` and `expand`) were used, it would raise `Warning: 'length(x) = 4 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)'`. In R 4.3, this warning changed to an error. (#117)

webshot 0.5.4
=============

* Fixed #112: handling of Windows paths of the form "c:\file\path.html" did not work correctly. ([#114](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/114))

webshot 0.5.3
=============

* Fixed logic in `install_phantomjs()` when `force=TRUE` is used. ([#89](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/89))

* Fixed handling of `file://` URLs in Windows, when the URL contains a drive letter and colon, such as `"file://localhost/C:\\msys64"`. (#110, Thanks to Tomas Kalibera)

webshot 0.5.2
=============

* Modified `install_phantomjs()` function to only install a new version of PhantomJS if the installed version is out of date or it isn't installed. (@coatless, [#82](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/82))

* Added `force` parameter. When it is set to `TRUE`, `install_phantomjs()` will reinstall phantomjs. (@coatless, [#82](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/82))

* Added `is_phantomjs_installed()` function to check if PhantomJS was installed on the user's computer. (@coatless, [#82](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/82))

* Fixed `phantom_paths()` function to detect the path to PhantomJS on Linux (@coatless, @wildintellect, [#85](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/85))


webshot 0.5.1
=============

* Added `debug` parameter. When it is set to `TRUE`, `webshot()` will print out debugging messages from PhantomJS and CasperJS.

* Fixed [#51](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/51): Webshot had trouble with some sites that use HTTPS.

* Added `appshot.shiny.appobj` functionality (schloerke, [#55](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/55))

webshot 0.5.0
=============

* Added support for R Markdown documents. ([#48](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/48))

* Closed [#42](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/42): Converted some instances of `system2()` to use processx instead.

webshot 0.4.2
=============

* Fixed [#43](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/43): The `eval` argument for `webshot()` did not work.

webshot 0.4.1
=============

* Updated vignette so it doesn't error when PhantomJS is not present.

webshot 0.4.0
=============

* `webshot`, `resize`, and `shrink` all now accept a vector of URLs or filenames. (([#32](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/32)), [#33](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/33))

* Updated to CasperJS 1.1.3.

* Added `zoom` option for higher-resolution screen shots. ([#26](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/26))

* `webshot()` now returns objects with class `webshot`. There is also a new `knit_print` method for `webshot` objects. ([#27](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/27))

* Fixed problem installing PhantomJS on R 3.3.2 and above. ([#35](https://github.com/wch/webshot/pull/35))

webshot 0.3.2
=============

* Better handling of local paths in Windows. ([#23](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/23))

* More robust searching for ImageMagick. ([#13](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/13))

webshot 0.3.1
=============

* The leading tilde in the path of PhantomJS is expanded now ([#19](https://github.com/wch/webshot/issues/19)).
